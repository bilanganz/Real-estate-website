# Real-estate-website
In this course we create a real estate website from scrath using PHP.
Web Development - Intermediate is a project based course in which students will gain practical experience creating an interactive web site that will allow users to: register, update, login using sessions/cookies, upload images, receive email notifications, search and display records from a database. 
As the project is group based, students will learn about and use version control software. 
The practical portion requires students to work in groups to make professional level interactive Web applications in the PHP language, running on a Linux server (a UNIX-like OS).
Additionally, throughout the semester students will learn theory dealing with the World Wide Web. 
The theory portion will provide further in-depth knowledge with Internet related topics including: digital imaging, user testing, XML, internet security, credit card processing on the web, and MIME.
